# About this repository

This small size project is my first contact with the React world. The code present in this repository was produced during my completion of the Full-Stack Web Development with React Specialization on the Coursera platform (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack-react).
The purpose of this course was to create a restaurant website using the react framework. 
This project is for learning purposes only and is not maintained.

# How to run?
The course linked in the previous section provides all information needed to download, install and configure the required tools. 
Once everything is ready, start json-server:
```javascript
json-server --watch db.json -p 3001
```

Start react server:
```javascript
yarn start
```

The website will be available at http://localhost:3000/home
