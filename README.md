# coursera-frontend

This small size project is my first contact with the React world. The code present in this repository was produced during my completion of the Full-Stack Web Development with React Specialization on the Coursera platform (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack-react?).
The purpose of this course was to create a restaurant website using the react framework. 

# How to run?
